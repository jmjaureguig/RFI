# RFI
Mexico and world FM coverage, RFI for low-frequency experiments.

## Maps
* *fmMEXcoveragebyPower.png* FM coverage for Mexico using IFL and INEGI information, coverage zone defined by
power and frequency of stations.
* *fmCoverageByPower.png* FM coverage using fmlist.com information, defined by power and frequnecy of the stations.
* *fmCoverageByDistance.png* FM coverage using fmlist.com information, coverage zones are for 10, 50, 100 and 150 km.

## NOTES
* The maps overestimate the coverage of FM, good observing sites may exist due:
  - Mountains attenuations are not calculated (round Earth is supposed).
  - Isotropic antenna is supposed.
* **Where is the world-wide information?** fmlist.org offers free information for personal and no-commercial,
  with the restriction of not sharing the information. You can get the information from their site.
* **Then, why Mexico information is provided?** IFT (Federal Telecommunications Institute) and 
  INEGI (National Institute of Statistics and Geography) are two Mexican institutions that publish broadcast
  statins data under licenses enabling the share of them.
* fmlist data is a crowd-sourced effort and the information is incomplete and for some entries, not properely fill (some
  stations are listed on sub-watt power while other on the M-watt range. Therefore the world-wide map coverage calculated
  by power reflects a unrealistic map.
